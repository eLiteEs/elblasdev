I coded Tablas as a alpha on that time. Then I finished the alpha on the same month and abandoned that project until a few months ago.\nI updated all the code making the program prettier, fixing bugs, adding features, making the code more undestandable and more readable, etc... It's closed-source but I'm thinking of making it open-source.\n## Features\n1. **Sheets**: One file can have different sheets, like tabs.\n2. **Formulas**: Although this features isn't complete, you can use formulas like `=CALC(2+2)` or `=GET(A1` (those are the only formulas right now).",
